"""The date a refresh actually has to happen by.

End-of-security-support and end-of-support are two different kinds of over,
and the earlier one binds. A model can stay under a support contract for years
after its last security fix — TAC still takes the call, the box still cannot be
patched — so planning against end-of-support alone schedules the refresh for
after the estate is already carrying unpatchable hardware.
