"""Copy the standard's preferred image to devices ahead of their upgrade window.

A prestage policy names a device model. On each run, every active device of
that model gets a staging job for the preferred version of the software
standard that applies to it (Lifecycle plugin), unless it already runs that
version, is marked do not upgrade, already has a queued or active job, or
was given the same image within the policy's interval. A new preferred
version is a new image, so the next run stages it without waiting out the
interval.

Staging jobs go through the ordinary upgrade queue: the owning poller claims
them with --apply, checks flash, copies and verifies the image, and never
installs or reloads. They carry no redundancy groups, because a copy takes
nothing out of service.
