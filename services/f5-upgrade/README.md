# Remote execution service

A standalone remote for a central controller, with a versioned API, web console,
CLI and durable SQLite queue. It runs F5 upgrades over **SSH/SFTP only**, arbitrary
SSH commands, HTTPS requests (including Panorama requests targeting a firewall),
and asynchronous SNMP v3 walks. It has no NetBox dependency.

The main application submits jobs and polls their results. F5 upgrade sequencing,
reconnection, HA checks, backups, validation and rollback live on the remote.
For generic commands, the main application interprets the returned output and
submits a **separate** remediation job, optionally linked with `parent_job_id`.

API and worker processes share one local SQLite database, image cache, backup
root and credential keyring. Scale workers on **one host** with Docker or systemd.
SQLite WAL must not be placed on NFS/SMB or shared between hosts. Separate remotes
have independent reservations: the central application must assign an entire HA
pair/batch to one remote and prevent overlap across remotes.

## API contract

All `/api/v1` routes require `Authorization: Bearer <F5_API_TOKEN>`. The token
is a shared service identity loaded from `.env` or the service environment.
`/docs` and `/openapi.json` expose the schema; `/healthz` reports API availability.
`GET /api/v1/workers` reports worker heartbeats separately. The web console at `/`
keeps the token only in tab memory and uses the same API.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/devices` | Optional inventory IDs and connection addresses |
| POST | `/api/v1/plan` | Normalize a single upgrade and show inherited steps without device access |
| POST | `/api/v1/jobs` | Queue one F5 upgrade/backup/validation job |
| POST | `/api/v1/upgrade-batches` | Queue ordered waves with per-wave concurrency |
| GET | `/api/v1/upgrade-batches` or `/{id}` | Batch membership, wave progress and item results |
| POST | `/api/v1/ssh/jobs` | Queue one or more SSH commands |
| POST | `/api/v1/http/jobs` | Queue one or more HTTPS requests |
| GET | `/api/v1/http/targets` | Configured HTTP targets |
| POST | `/api/v1/snmp/walks` | Queue SNMP v3 OID subtree walks |
| GET | `/api/v1/snmp/walks/{id}` | Walk status and per-root progress |
| GET | `/api/v1/snmp/walks/{id}/results?after=0&limit=500` | Paginated partial/final rows |
| GET | `/api/v1/jobs?limit=100&offset=0` or `/jobs/{id}` | Jobs and full results/credential audit |
| GET | `/api/v1/jobs/{id}/events?after=0&limit=500` | Ordered events; advance cursor to last `seq` |
| GET | `/api/v1/jobs/{id}/backup` | Download completed UCS backup |
| POST | `/api/v1/jobs/{id}/cancel` | Durable cancellation request |
| POST | `/api/v1/jobs/{id}/validation-decisions` | Accept/retry a particular validation gate |
| POST | `/api/v1/jobs/{id}/mark-done` | Manually complete an item for the wave barrier |
| POST | `/api/v1/jobs/{id}/rollback` | Reboot to the original recorded volume |
| POST | `/api/v1/jobs/{id}/resolve` | Release an inspected recovery reservation |
| GET | `/api/v1/credentials` | Credential metadata only |
| PUT | `/api/v1/credentials/{profile}` | Idempotent full replacement/upsert |
| POST | `/api/v1/credentials/rotate` | Re-encrypt records using the first key in the keyring |

Job creation returns HTTP `202` with an `id`, `kind`, `status`, normalized
`request`, `result`, `lock_held`, credential audit and validation gates. Poll
`GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}`. Batch creation returns a batch ID and `status_url`, child
job IDs, wave progress and item statuses. No synchronous device work occurs in
API handlers.

Use a durable, unique `Idempotency-Key` for each submission, batch, rollback or
validation decision. Reuse the **same key and body** after a lost API response.
A conflicting reuse returns `409`. Invalid input is `422`, missing resources
`404`, and invalid authentication `401`. Validation errors exclude submitted
values so malformed credential requests do not echo passwords.

Terminal job states are `succeeded`, `completed_with_warnings`, `failed`,
`cancelled`, `recovery_required`, `resolved` and `manually_completed`.
`needs_review` waits for an operator decision; it is not completion.
`queued` and `running` need continued polling. A terminal state may still hold
reservations: inspect `lock_held`. Batch `needs_attention` requires action on its
items; `completed` means every item passed its wave barrier.

## Upgrade payload

    },
    "validation_policy": {
      "noncritical_differences": "warn",
      "on_timeout": "needs_review",
      "consecutive_passes": 2,
      "settling_seconds": 30
    },
    "validation_timeout": 600
  },
  "waves": [
    {"wave": 1, "upgrade_at_a_time": 2, "ips": ["192.0.2.10", "192.0.2.11", "192.0.2.12"]},
    {"wave": 2, "upgrade_at_a_time": 1, "ips": ["192.0.2.20", "192.0.2.21"]}
  ],
  "overrides": {
    "192.0.2.12": {"target_volume": "HD1.3", "credential_profiles": ["ssh-local"]}
  }
}
```

Send this to `/api/v1/upgrade-batches`. For a single job, send the defaults plus
`"device":"192.0.2.10"` to `/api/v1/jobs`. Device can be an inventory ID or IP.
Version/build examples are illustrative; your allowlist is the upgrade policy,
not an embedded vendor compatibility database.

Omit `target_volume` to discover a destination: prefer an inactive complete
volume matching the final requested version/build, otherwise reuse the lowest
eligible inactive volume for installation, otherwise create the next volume on
the active disk. A reboot-only request requires a matching existing volume.
The active volume is always preserved as the rollback target. The selected volume
is recorded in `result.target_volume`. Never pass an administrative partition
such as `/Common` as a boot volume.

Omit `credential_profiles` to try all enabled, eligible profiles for that
transport, ordered by `priority` then profile ID. An explicit list restricts the
attempts and establishes their initial order. A connection prefers its last
successful profile on reconnect, then falls back after authentication rejection.
Inventory/HTTP target defaults may restrict the eligible profiles for a target.

| Upgrade option | Behavior/default |
| --- | --- |
| `transfer` | Upload images from `F5_IMAGE_ROOT`; verify SHA-256 and vendor catalog metadata |
| `images` | Ordered `{name,sha256,version,build,kind}`; optional HTTPS `source_url` downloads to local cache |
| `images_on_device` | Skip inherited upload; still verify checksum/metadata |
| `create_ucs` | Save config, create UCS, download and verify size/checksum |
| `ucs_unencrypted` | Implies UCS; no encryption passphrase, private keys remain included |
| `ucs_credential` | Optional UCS passphrase profile; otherwise first eligible UCS profile |
| `backup_directory` | Relative directory beneath `F5_BACKUP_ROOT`; implies UCS |
| `install` | Implies UCS, transfer unless already on device, image checks, installation and configuration copy |
| `reboot` | Implies UCS and configuration copy; verify new boot identity and exact volume/version/build |
| `expected_version`, `expected_build` | Required for reboot-only; inferred from final image when installing |
| `allowed_source_versions` | Required exact running-version allowlist for install/reboot |
| `approved_models` | Optional allowlist matching marketing name or platform ID |
| `license_check_date` | Optional minimum license service-check date, `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `minimum_free_bytes` | Required free reserve on image filesystem; default 1,500,000,000 bytes |
| `cleanup_images` | Opt-in deletion of catalogued old installers, excluding requested images, if space is insufficient |
| `install_timeout` | Per-image install and configuration-copy timeout; default 3600 seconds |
| `reboot_timeout` | Verified reboot timeout; default 900 seconds |
| `validation_timeout` | Bounded validation window; default 600, maximum 86400 seconds |

The installer reuses an exact final version/build when available. **It always
saves the current configuration and runs `cpcfg --source=<current> <target>`,
including reused volumes.** It requires a verified zero exit status. Copy progress
and its private on-device log directory are recorded. An ambiguous install/copy
is never automatically replayed.

Verified images already on the device skip SFTP upload. HTTPS cache downloads
require SHA-256, verified TLS and no redirects or embedded credentials. A download
is limited to 30 GiB/two hours and committed atomically. SFTP uses a temporary
remote filename and verifies it before rename. Transfer progress includes bytes
and percentage. Installer cleanup never deletes boot volumes.

### Drain and HA behavior

Standalone draining disables **virtual addresses**, never virtual servers. It
records original enabled states and changes only enabled addresses. Choose a
remaining count or `reduction_percent` (not both) in `standalone_drain`.
A 90% reduction from 1,000 connections means 100 remaining. Counts sum clientside
virtual-server connections; they are not a complete system connection-table count.

The flat fields `drain`, `drain_connections`, `drain_percent`, `drain_timeout`, and
`reboot_on_drain_timeout` remain supported. Their default timeout is 300 seconds;
`standalone_drain.timeout_seconds` defaults to 600. With no threshold, drain to zero.
Draining requires reboot. Timeout restores addresses and stops unless forced
reboot on timeout was explicitly selected.

Disabled states are saved and copied into the target so traffic stays drained
through reboot and validation. After successful or manually accepted validation,
restore only addresses disabled by this job, save, and collect the final snapshot.
Before reboot, cancellation/error attempts restoration. Uncertain boots retain
recovery state and reservations instead of issuing blind cleanup.

HA discovery verifies a two-member sync-failover pair through both members and
locks the cluster plus both management endpoints across workers and batches.
Only submitted members are upgraded. The current active member may run first:
verify healthy peer/traffic ownership, explicitly fail over to it, confirm the
handoff, then reboot. HA jobs **do not disable shared virtual addresses**.
Before upgrading the second member, verify that the upgraded peer has completed
validation and can carry traffic. Mixed-version handoffs need that saved peer
validation. Sync is deferred while versions/builds differ; when equal, use the
active member as the sync source and verify completion. Unknown topology,
active-active groups, unhealthy peers and changing ownership stop the operation.

Within each wave, devices are claimed in submitted order when eligible, up to
`upgrade_at_a_time`; a reserved pair cannot overlap. A later wave starts only
after every previous item is `succeeded`, `completed_with_warnings` or
`manually_completed`. A validation pause frees a worker slot but retains device
and HA reservations. This permits unrelated devices to progress.

### Validation and manual control

Pre/post reports include WAF policy counts, names and attributes; ASM readiness;
up/total and per-object state for virtual servers, pools, nodes and virtual IPs;
pool active members; VLANs, self IPs, routes, management routes/IPs, provisioning,
interfaces, trunks, iRule names and certificate expiry fields. Collection gaps
are explicit. Dynamic `_auto` nodes are excluded from stable inventory comparisons.

Object deltas are reported individually. Minor monitor or inventory differences
are **warnings by default**, so a few nodes going down cannot trap the wave.
ASM readiness, boot identity/version and HA health are blocking checks. Validation
has bounded settling/retries. `on_timeout` chooses `needs_review` (default) or
`fail`. Strict environments may select `noncritical_differences: require_review`
and set `ltm_min_unchanged_percent`/`waf_min_unchanged_percent`; both default to 100.
Other configuration changes still require review in strict mode. Two consecutive
acceptable samples are the default; a zero-second validation window takes one.
No-reboot jobs validate the current runtime, not the staged software.

A waiting job exposes a gate with `id`, `revision`, `phase` and `findings`. Send:

```http
POST /api/v1/jobs/JOB_ID/validation-decisions
Idempotency-Key: change123-accept-gate1
Content-Type: application/json

{"action":"accept","gate_id":"GATE_UUID","validation_revision":1,"operator":"jason","reason":"Validated application traffic manually"}
```

`retry` runs that validation again. `accept` records the waiver and continues with
the remaining restoration/traffic/sync steps. It does **not** reinstall or reboot.
The decision transitions `pending` → `applied`, with stale revisions rejected.
The audit retains the findings and operator reason; acceptance is not a fake pass.

`POST /jobs/{id}/mark-done` takes `{"operator":"jason","reason":"..."}`.
It advances the wave barrier for a stopped item but **retains unresolved
reservations**. For a running item it requests cancellation first; the worker
must acknowledge before status becomes `manually_completed`. Unrelated devices
may continue, but its HA peer stays blocked until recovery is reconciled.

`POST /jobs/{id}/cancel` cancels queued jobs immediately. Running workers observe
safe checkpoints: transfers can stop; install/cpcfg must finish; drains restore
before reboot; a requested reboot must reconnect/verify first. Cancellation after
reboot retains recovery for inspection. Killing a worker never means a remote
command stopped. Missing heartbeats fence SSH/HTTP/F5 jobs as `recovery_required`;
there is no automatic replay. `SIGTERM` gracefully finishes the current job.

To release recovery, stop the owning worker, inspect any in-flight device commands,
boot state and saved drain state, then send:

```json
{"worker_stopped":true,"device_inspected":true,"note":"Worker stopped; device and address states reconciled"}
```

Use `/jobs/{id}/resolve`. These are operator attestations, not remotely proven
facts. Resolving a manually completed item preserves its wave completion status.

Optional `validation_policy.waf_request_check: true` checks for new WAF traffic
after restoration. Standby units and units without policies skip it. Configure a
read-only inventory `waf_request_command` that emits JSON
`{"id":"request-id","timestamp":"2026-10-28T12:00:00+00:00"}` over SSH from your
local request-log adapter. The timestamp must be timezone-aware and between the
reboot request and now. No HTTP calls or log-byte-growth guesses are used.
Without an adapter/new request, the bounded gate requires manual validation;
request logging and incoming traffic must exist for automatic proof.

### Rollback

The original active volume/version/build is saved before mutation. Submit `{}`
to `/jobs/{id}/rollback` with its own idempotency key. The linked job checks that
the device still runs the upgrade target and the original volume is intact,
performs a healthy HA handoff when needed, reboots to the original volume,
restores tracked drain state and validates. An uncertain source job holding a
reservation requires `{"worker_stopped":true}`; ownership transfers atomically
to the rollback job. A staged-only job must actually boot its target first.

Rollback does not import UCS, recreate deleted partitions, or automatically
carry later configuration changes back. Keep database, backups and keyring as a
recovery set. Back up SQLite with its online backup API, or stop all processes
before copying its database/WAL files. No automatic purge removes rollback history.

## Generic SSH and HTTP jobs

```json
{"device":"192.0.2.10","commands":[{"command":"tmsh show sys version","timeout_seconds":60},{"command":"tmsh list sys provision","timeout_seconds":60}],"stop_on_error":true}
```

Submit to `/ssh/jobs`. Results contain each command index, stdout, stderr, exit
code, elapsed seconds and authenticated profile. Nonzero exit is failure; the
output is not interpreted as a remediation rule. `stop_on_error:false` continues
the sequence. Maximum 100 operations, 32 MiB command/job results and a configurable
`job_timeout` (default 7200 seconds). A lost/timeout command response is fenced,
not retried. Closing SSH cannot guarantee the command stopped on the device.

Configure HTTPS targets in `F5_HTTP_TARGETS_FILE` (see
`http-targets.example.json`). Each has a fixed HTTPS origin and an explicitly
read-only authentication probe. This probe is required even for GET jobs because
some device APIs perform operations through GET. TLS certificates are verified;
`ca_file` supports a private CA. Redirects and environment proxies are disabled.

For Panorama, provision an HTTP profile using `scheme:header`, `header:X-PAN-KEY`
and an encrypted API key in `token`. The example probe uses `type=version`.
Then submit this to `/http/jobs`:

```json
{"target":"panorama","requests":[{"method":"POST","path":"/api/","form":{"type":"op","target":"FIREWALL_SERIAL","cmd":"<show><system><info/></system></show>"}}]}
```

The probe selects a credential **before** sending an operation. An HTTP 401 or
Panorama authentication rejection can move to the next profile. Permission errors,
network failures, and ambiguous operation replies do not trigger credential replay.
The actual operation is sent once. Results include HTTP status, response body,
selected content/location/retry headers, duration and profile. HTTP 2xx determines
transport success; the main application must interpret vendor body errors.
Responses are bounded to 4 MiB each/32 MiB per job. Basic, bearer and named-header
credentials are supported. Use `params`, `form`, `json_body` or `body` as appropriate;
paths must remain relative to the configured target. Authentication belongs in
profiles rather than submitted headers. `parent_job_id` links follow-up jobs.

## Encrypted credentials and Ansible

Device credentials are encrypted in SQLite with authenticated Fernet encryption.
The independent keyring file is owner-only and configured by
`F5_CREDENTIAL_KEY_FILE`. It contains one Fernet key per line; the first encrypts,
all can decrypt. Back up it separately from the database. This protects a stolen
DB copy, not a compromised remote/root account: the running service can decrypt.

Generate once with `f5-upgrade init-key /path/credentials.key`. Upsert profiles
using the API; GET returns only ID, kind, priority, enabled, revision and timestamp.
Identical PUTs do not bump revisions; changed secrets/metadata do. Omit profiles
from requests for automatic selection; `targets` can limit them to exact IPs or
inventory/HTTP target IDs. Disable a profile with a full PUT containing
`enabled:false`. Existing established sessions finish; reconnects read current
profile revisions without restarting workers.

Example credential bodies for `PUT /api/v1/credentials/PROFILE_ID`:

```json
{"kind":"ssh","username":"root","password":"SECRET","priority":20,"targets":["192.0.2.10"]}
```

```json
{"kind":"snmp","username":"reader","security_level":"authPriv","auth_protocol":"SHA256","auth_password":"SECRET_AT_LEAST_8_BYTES","priv_password":"SECRET_AT_LEAST_8_BYTES"}
```

```json
{"kind":"http","scheme":"header","header":"X-PAN-KEY","token":"SECRET"}
```

```json
{"kind":"ucs","passphrase":"SECRET"}
```

SSH also accepts private-key PEM in `private_key` and its optional `passphrase`.
HTTP basic uses `scheme:basic`, `username`, `password`; bearer uses `token`.
UCS encryption selects the first eligible passphrase profile, since archive
creation has no remote authentication test. A specified `ucs_credential`
restricts that choice. Unencrypted UCS must be explicitly requested.

Authentication fallbacks record profile ID, revision, target, protocol, phase,
time and outcome. `credential_summary.profiles_used`, `current_profile`, and
`multiple_profiles_used` distinguish successful credentials from rejected attempts.
The complete `credential_usage` history identifies TACACS before reboot and local
credentials afterward. Known secret strings are redacted from generic command
responses; treat arbitrary device output as sensitive regardless. Do not embed
secrets in commands or HTTP payloads, which are retained as job requests.

Only positive authentication rejection triggers fallback; transport/host-key/
permission failures do not. Rejected target/profile revisions cool down for
60 seconds, shared across workers. SNMP agents may silently discard bad digests;
a timeout alone cannot prove bad credentials and does not trigger guessing.
All eligible profiles are tried when no selection is specified. Pin a smaller
list per job or target when appropriate for device authentication policies.

For key rotation: atomically write an owner-only keyring containing **new key
first, old keys after it**; call `/credentials/rotate`; retain old keys until all
processes/backup recovery needs are accounted for, then remove them. Rotation
rewrites ciphertext transactionally without changing credential IDs or revisions.
Never overwrite the only key before rotating the database.

`deploy/ansible/deploy.yml` provisions Ubuntu 24.04/RHEL 9, systemd API/workers,
private directories, a key generated **only if missing**, and idempotent credential
upserts over the remote's loopback API. Supply `executor_api_token` and
`executor_credentials` from **Ansible Vault**, not plaintext repository variables.
Credential tasks have `no_log:true`; only the API token/key path is in service.env.

```yaml
# Encrypt this file with ansible-vault before storing it.
executor_api_token: REPLACE_WITH_RANDOM_TOKEN_AT_LEAST_32_CHARACTERS
executor_workers: 3
executor_credentials:
  ssh-tacacs:
    kind: ssh
    username: automation
    password: REPLACE_WITH_SECRET
    priority: 10
  ssh-local:
    kind: ssh
    username: root
    password: REPLACE_WITH_SECRET
    priority: 20
  ucs:
    kind: ucs
    passphrase: REPLACE_WITH_SECRET
```

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory deploy/ansible/deploy.yml -e @vault.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

Set `executor_devices`, `executor_http_targets`, and verified
`executor_known_hosts` for your environment. Existing workers drain before code
updates; new workers start after credential provisioning. The playbook does not
set up your external TLS proxy. To change credentials without redeploying code,
use the same `ansible.builtin.uri` PUT task with `no_log:true`; full replacements
are idempotent. Rebuilt remotes can generate a fresh key and repopulate credentials
from Vault, but lost job/backup volumes cannot reconstruct rollback history.

Legacy inventory references (`password_env`, `key_file`, `key_passphrase_env`,
`ucs_passphrase_env`) and SNMP profile files remain supported for migration.
Once encrypted profiles of a protocol exist, automatic selection uses them.
Explicit legacy SNMP `profile` can still select a configured environment profile.
New deployments should use encrypted profiles.

## SNMP v3 walks

Submit an IPv4/IPv6 address and numeric OID subtrees to `/snmp/walks`:

```json
{"device_ip":"192.0.2.10","oids":["1.3.6.1.2.1.1","1.3.6.1.4.1.3375"]}
```

`credential_profiles` optionally restricts selection. SNMP v3 only: authPriv,
authNoPriv or noAuthNoPriv, SHA/SHA224/SHA256/SHA384/SHA512, AES128 privacy.
Authentication/privacy passphrases need at least eight UTF-8 bytes. Profiles
support a context name. Credentials never appear in walk job requests.

Walks use GETNEXT, one root at a time, and stop at the subtree boundary. To retrieve
a scalar instance, walk its parent. Roots can overlap; results retain `root_oid`.
An accessible empty subtree succeeds, but SNMP cannot distinguish absent data
from data hidden by the agent's access controls.

Poll the job and `/snmp/walks/{id}/results?after=0&limit=500`. Rows contain
`seq,root_oid,oid,type,value,encoding`; the page contains `finished`, `has_more`
and `next_cursor`. Advance `after` to `next_cursor`. Stop only when `finished`
is true **and** `has_more` is false. Empty live pages require continued polling.
Octet strings are base64; integers/counters and other textual values are strings
to preserve precision. IP addresses are dotted text.

Bounds: 1–64 roots; port 161 default; per-request timeout 2 seconds (0.1–30),
retries 1 (0–5); job timeout 300 seconds (1–3600); maximum rows 10000
(1–100000). A fixed 16 MiB result limit also applies. Limits/timeouts fail the job
with partial results retained. Authentication fallback is allowed before a root
produces data; partial roots are never replayed with another identity.

Walks to the same IP/port serialize; SNMP reads may overlap upgrades and observe
transitional state. Stale SNMP workers fail and release their read reservations.
Cancellation retains committed rows. Job/result retention is manual.

## Deployment and CLI

Python 3.11+ is required. Ubuntu 24.04 supplies 3.12; use the Python 3.11 suite
on RHEL 9.2+. Install pinned `requirements.lock`, then the package with `--no-deps`.
Native systemd units and environment example are in `deploy/`; the Ansible
playbook automates this setup. API/workers must share the same paths and user.
The image/cache directory must be writable for URL downloads.

Docker, from this directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
mkdir -p config images
printf '[]\n' > config/devices.json
cp http-targets.example.json config/http-targets.json
# Populate token in .env, target configuration and VERIFIED config/known_hosts.
# Generate config/credentials.key once using the installed CLI, or the image:
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm --no-deps --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -v "$PWD/config:/key-output:z" api f5-upgrade init-key /key-output/credentials.key
# Set private key/config ownership to container UID 10001; never world-readable.
# Also grant UID 10001 write access to images/ for the cache.
chmod 600 .env
docker compose up -d --scale worker=3
```

Use an HTTPS reverse proxy for central API access; default bind is loopback.
Persist `data`, `backups`, and the external keyring. Do not use `down -v` if job
history is needed. SELinux mounts use `:z` for sharing. Containers run as UID 10001.

SSH uses verified known_hosts and rejects unknown/changed keys. The device account
needs bash, SFTP, tmsh administrator rights and filesystem access for images/UCS;
no implicit sudo or restricted-shell bypass is attempted. Use canonical inventory
addresses and do not change identities/lock groups while jobs are active.

```bash
f5-upgrade plan --device 192.0.2.10 --install --images images.json \
  --allowed-source-version 16.1.5 --no-reboot
f5-upgrade request --kind batch --file batch.json --idempotency-key change123
f5-upgrade request --kind ssh --file commands.json
f5-upgrade request --kind http --file requests.json
f5-upgrade request --kind snmp --file walk.json
f5-upgrade credential-put ssh-local --file -       # JSON from stdin
f5-upgrade job JOB_UUID
f5-upgrade batch BATCH_UUID
f5-upgrade cancel JOB_UUID
f5-upgrade validation JOB_UUID --action accept --gate-id GATE_UUID --revision 1 \
  --operator jason --reason 'Application traffic verified'
f5-upgrade mark-done JOB_UUID --operator jason --reason 'Handled manually'
f5-upgrade rollback JOB_UUID --idempotency-key change123-rollback
f5-upgrade resolve JOB_UUID --worker-stopped --device-inspected \
  --note 'Worker stopped; boot and address state reconciled'
```

Use `request --file -` for stdin. Flat upgrade options have named CLI flags;
JSON exposes every advanced policy. Set `F5_API_URL`/`F5_API_TOKEN` in `.env`
or use `--url`/`--env-file`. Secrets are never command-line credential arguments.

## Verification and platform scope

Tests cover SQLite concurrency and wave barriers, credential encryption/rotation,
fallback/audit, cancellation, manual continuation without replay, HA active-first
handoff, HTTP operation fencing, image/config/drain/rollback sequencing, synthetic
F5 parsers, and real SNMP v3 loopback exchanges. Run:

```bash
pip install -e '.[test]'
pytest -q
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
node --check f5_upgrade/static/app.js
```

Real-appliance acceptance on your exact TMOS versions is still required. Supported
scope is single-system BIG-IP appliances/VE and verified two-member active/standby
pairs. F5OS, VIPRION slot orchestration, vCMP hosts, active-active traffic groups
and multi-host shared queues are not implemented. Unrecognized critical device
output fails closed. The WAF traffic gate requires the configured log adapter or
manual acceptance; it does not assume a universal SSH request-log interface.
